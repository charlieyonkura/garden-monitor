This project gave me greater insight into working on a project with a team. My friend Paul independently worked on data.py and data.db on a separate branch while I worked on the website portion. We learned to communicate the structure of our code and we planned how to mesh our separate portions together.

This project gave me a basic look into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Jinja2 was used for creating HTML templates and integrating with Python code. My python code can be found in website.py. HTML can be found in templates. CSS is in static/css.
